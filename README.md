# Heardit



FOR music fans who want to have passionate and involved discussions about music and artists. THE Hearddit is a Web-based forum THAT provides a platform where users can create accounts, make and comment on posts, create message threads, and embed songs. UNLIKE Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter, OUR PRODUCT specifically revolves around the topic of music, allowing smaller communities and focused discussion to take place without the distraction of other topics.
